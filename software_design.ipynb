    "1. **Decomposable** – can be broken down into modules to reduce complexity and allow teamwork\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Composable** – enable code to be reused in many places\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understandable** – one module can be examined, reasoned about, developed, etc. in isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuity** – a small change in the requirements should affect a small number of modules\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Isolation** – an error in one module should be as contained as possible\n",

    "Cohesion – internal consistency\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "::: fragment\n",
    "For example, how you handle errors, how you name variables, how you process data, etc. Changing your coding style from function to function can make it harder to understand and maintain your code.\n",

    "Following our \"separate code into small pieces\" idea, our first thought might be to write a single function that can gather data from any our sources -- at the very least, you have separated out the data gathering from the data processing.\n",
